# BirdCLEF Competition: Identifying Eastern African Bird Species by Sound

Welcome to the repository for our project in the BirdCLEF competition. The primary objective of this competition was to develop advanced machine learning models capable of accurately identifying bird species in Eastern Africa based on their sound recordings. Our project sought to contribute to NATURAL STATE's ongoing efforts in monitoring avian biodiversity and evaluating restoration projects within the region.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following:

- **Code:** This directory houses the codebase for our project. It includes scripts for preprocessing the audio data, extracting relevant features, and implementing the machine learning models employed for bird species identification.

- **Data_Input:** The `data/` directory contains the provided training data as well as the test data used for evaluation. It serves as the foundation for our analysis and model development.

- **Results:** All results obtained from the trained models are stored in the `results/` folder. This section provides insights and analysis based on the model predictions and can serve as a valuable resource for understanding our project's outcomes.

- **Report:** The `Report/` directory contains our comprehensive project report. It covers all aspects of the project, including the motivation, problem statement, data description, methods, results, discussions, and conclusions. The report also includes relevant references and acknowledgments.

- **README.md:** You are currently reading the README file, which provides an overview of the repository's contents and project background.
